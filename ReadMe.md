# FLock Model AI with IP NFT

## Introduction

This is a Eth Denver 2024 Hackathon Project buiild on top of Story Protocol.

## Motivation

The open-source model faces challenges in monetization and incentives, often leading to projects becoming obsolete or being absorbed by larger tech firms. To tackle these issues, we propose a model tokenization strategy utilizing Intellectual Property (IP) Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to represent models. Each IP NFT links to a token-bounded smart contract account, enabling effective digital asset management.

This approach allows for the tracking of model usage and contributions. By considering each fine-tuned model as a derivative of a base model, we introduce a transparent system to manage and compensate contributions through the Story Protocol. This protocol tracks usage and issues license NFTs for clear usage terms, while also managing royalties, ensuring contributors are fairly compensated.

Our solution promotes a sustainable open-source ecosystem by leveraging blockchain and NFTs for transparency, fair compensation, and incentive mechanisms. This strategy addresses current open-source model challenges, fostering a vibrant community and encouraging continued innovation and development.

## How it works

- The user can create a new model and register it as an IP NFT
- The user can then issue a license NFT for the model
- The user can create policy.
- The user can attach policy to the model
- The user can mint a license NFT for the model

## Challenges I ran into

A lot of the challenges came from the Story protocol's smart contract, the version v0.1-beta is quite unstable. Both use and understanding the smart contract took a long time
